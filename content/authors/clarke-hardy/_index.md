I am currently pursuing a PhD in experimental particle physics with a focus on rare event searches. I have previously worked with three international collaborations searching for dark matter, and now work on [nEXO](https://nexo.llnl.gov), a planned tonne-scale experiment to search for [neutrinoless double beta decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrinoless_double_beta_decay). The experience in data analysis and statistics I acquired from these projects has enabled me to make key contributions outside my own field, in particular to the [search for modifications to gravity](https://web.stanford.edu/group/grattalab/gravity/index.html) at short distances using optically levitated microspheres. My day-to-day work consists of data analysis, software development, detector R&D, and lab management.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching math and physics. I am a member of the volunteer faculty at [Mount Tamalpais College](https://www.mttamcollege.edu), an institution offering degree programs to the incarcerated population of San Quentin State Prison. In this role I have been an instructor for precalculus and physics and a substitute instructor and tutor for other math courses.
