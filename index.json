[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am currently pursuing a PhD in experimental particle physics with a specific focus on rare event searches. I have previously worked with three international collaborations searching for dark matter, and now work on nEXO, a planned tonne-scale experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. I am enthusiastic about finding new ways to enhance our experimental sensitivity to the physics of interest using machine learning techniques. My day-to-day work consists of data analysis, software development, detector R\u0026amp;D, and lab management.\nIn addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching math and physics. I am a member of the volunteer faculty at Mount Tamalpais College, an institution offering degree programs to the incarcerated population of San Quentin State Prison. In this role I have been an instructor for precalculus and physics and a substitute for other math courses.\nYou can download my CV here.
